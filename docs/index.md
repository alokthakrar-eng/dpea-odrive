## Welcome to the DPEA ODrive Guide

This page is meant to be a resource to help you get your ODrive up and running as smoothly as possible.
Additionally, this is not meant to be a replacement for 
the [official ODrive documentation](https://docs.odriverobotics.com/v/latest/index.html), but rather it will 
highlight the various ways you can incorporate the ODrive library into Python. For any advanced usage of 
ODrive, please refer to the official ODrive documentation.
